# vagrant_hosts.yml
#
# List of hosts to be created by Vagrant. This file controls the Vagrant
# settings, specifically host name and network settings. You should at least
# have a `name:`.  Other optional settings that can be specified:
#
# * `ip`: by default, an IP will be assigned by DHCP. If you want a fixed
#         addres, specify it.
# * `netmask`: by default, the network mask is `255.255.255.0`. If you want
#              another one, it should be specified.
# * `mac`: The MAC address to be assigned to the NIC. Several notations are
#          accepted, including "Linux-style" (`00:11:22:33:44:55`) and
#          "Windows-style" (`00-11-22-33-44-55`). The separator characters can
#          be omitted altogether (`001122334455`).
# * `intnet`: If set to `true`, the network interface will be attached to an
#             internal network rather than a host-only adapter.
# * `auto_config`: If set to `false`, Vagrant will not attempt to configure
#                  the network interface.
# * `synced_folders`: A list of dicts that specify synced folders. `src` and
#   `dest` are mandatory, `options:` are optional. For the possible options,
#   see the Vagrant documentation[1]. Keys of options should be prefixed with
#   a colon, e.g. `:owner:`.
#
# To enable *provisioning*, add these hosts to site.yml and assign some roles.
#
